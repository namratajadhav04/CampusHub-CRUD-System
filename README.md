# 🎓 CampusHub - MERN Stack CRUD System

## 📘 Introduction

**CampusHub** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)**. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage campus-related data through basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This project demonstrates how a structured, scalable, and responsive application can be built using modern web technologies.

- Allows users to add, view, edit, and delete student or admin records.
- Demonstrates seamless integration between frontend and backend using RESTful APIs.
- Provides a clean and responsive user interface.
- Offers a practical implementation of full-stack development for learning and portfolio purposes.
